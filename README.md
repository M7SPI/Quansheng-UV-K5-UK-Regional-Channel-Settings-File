# Quansheng-UV-K5-UK-Regional-Channel-Settings-File
These are my UK regional channel setting files for the quansheng uv-k5.
The img files are to be used with chirp next programming software.
The cxf files are to be used with original quansheng programming software.
This is mainly for licensed hams but dont mind helping those that are learning and just want to listen in to your local repeaters. The channel settings files will hold the PMR Channels 1 to 16, 2meter simplex channels, 70cm simplex channels also repeaters within 100 miles of your local town. These are UK channel setting files.
